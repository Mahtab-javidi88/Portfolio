### üìú Overview
This project showcases the use of SQL for analyzing **Superstore Sales Dataset**, uncovering key trends, and measuring business performance metrics. The analysis aims to derive actionable insights that support data-driven decision-making.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Skills and Tools
- **SQL**: Aggregations, Joins, Subqueries, Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- **Data Analysis**: Revenue trends, top-selling products, customer segmentation, regional performance
- **Database Management**: Efficient handling of relational databases with large datasets
- **Visualization**: Interactive and actionable charts using Power BI

---

### üîë Highlights
