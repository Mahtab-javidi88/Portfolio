# üìä Sales Data Analysis with SQL

## üìú Overview
This project demonstrates how SQL can be utilized to analyze sales data, identify key trends, and measure business performance metrics. The focus is on creating meaningful insights from raw data and supporting data-driven decision-making.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Key Skills and Tools**
- **SQL**: Aggregations, Joins, Subqueries, Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- **Data Analysis**: Revenue trends, top-selling products, and regional performance
- **Database Management**: Working with relational databases to handle large datasets
- **Visualization**: Clear and actionable charts using Power BI

## üîë **Highlights**
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Includes revenue trends over time, customer segmentation, and identifying peak sales periods.
- **KPIs Measured**: Total sales, revenue growth, average order value (AOV), and customer lifetime value (CLV).
- **Advanced SQL Techniques**:
  - Window functions for cumulative calculations.
  - Correlated subqueries for detailed insights.
  - CTEs for clear and modular SQL queries.

## üóÇÔ∏è **Data Description**
- **Sales Data**: Simulated data with transactions, customer info, product categories, and time-series records.
- **Database Format**: Stored in a relational schema with tables for customers, transactions, and products.

### Data Schema
1. **Customers Table**:
   - `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
   - `CustomerName`: Name of the customer.
   - `Region`: Geographic region.
2. **Transactions Table**:
   - `TransactionID`: Unique transaction identifier.
   - `Date`: Date of the transaction.
   - `CustomerID`: Foreign key linking to the Customers table.
   - `ProductID`: Foreign key linking to the Products table.
   - `Amount`: Transaction amount.
3. **Products Table**:
   - `ProductID`: Unique identifier for each product.
   - `ProductName`: Name of the product.
   - `Category`: Product category.

## üß∞ **Steps in the Analysis**
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Identified and handled missing or inconsistent data using SQL functions.
   - Standardized date formats and resolved duplicate entries.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzed revenue distribution across regions.
   - Studied sales performance over time.
   - Identified high-performing products and categories.
3. **KPI Calculations**:
   - Revenue growth rate.
   - Retention rates by customer segments.
   - Average Order Value (AOV).
4. **Actionable Insights**:
   - Pinpointed top-performing regions, products, and seasonal trends.

## üìà **Results**
- Growth rate over the last quarter increased by **15%**.
- The top 5 products accounted for **40%** of total revenue.
- Weekends were identified as peak sales periods.
- Region "North" outperformed others with a **25%** higher revenue share.

## üìä **Visualizations**
Included Power BI dashboards:
- **Revenue Trends**: Line chart showing monthly revenue.
- **Top Products**: Bar chart of the highest-selling products.
- **Regional Performance**: Heatmap showing revenue distribution by region.

## üìÇ **Repository Contents**
- `SQL Scripts`: Contains all SQL queries used in the analysis.
  ```sql
  -- Example Query: Calculate total sales by region
  SELECT Region, SUM(Amount) AS TotalSales
  FROM Transactions
  JOIN Customers ON Transactions.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID
  GROUP BY Region;
  ```
- `Data`: Sample datasets for replication.
  - `customers.csv`: Contains customer information.
  - `transactions.csv`: Contains transaction records.
  - `products.csv`: Contains product details.
- `Analysis Report`: Summary of insights and visualizations in PDF format.
- `Power BI Dashboard`: Interactive file (.pbix).
- `Guides`: Step-by-step instructions for replicating the analysis.
