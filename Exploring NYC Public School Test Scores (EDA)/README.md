# 🏫 Exploring NYC Public School Test Scores (EDA)

## 📜 Overview
This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on NYC public school test results. The goal is to uncover trends and identify patterns in student performance across different schools, boroughs, and demographics.

## 🛠️ **Key Skills and Tools**
- **Python**: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Trend identification, statistical analysis, and visualization.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating clear, impactful visualizations to communicate findings.

## 🔑 **Highlights**
- **Insightful Analysis**: 
  - Trends in test scores across boroughs.
  - Performance variations by school type and demographics.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: 
  - Correlation heatmaps to explore relationships between variables.
  - Distribution plots to analyze score variations.
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Focused on average test scores, distribution trends, and performance disparities.

## 🗂️ **Data Description**
- **Dataset**: NYC public school test scores dataset.
  - Includes information on schools, boroughs, student demographics, and test scores.
- **File Format**: CSV file with columns for school name, borough, test scores, and additional attributes.

## 🧰 **Steps in the Analysis**
1. **Data Loading**: Imported the dataset and examined its structure.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Addressed missing or inconsistent data.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Identified trends and relationships.
   - Visualized score distributions and correlations.
4. **Actionable Insights**: Summarized key findings to guide potential educational interventions.

## 📈 **Results**
- Schools in **Manhattan** displayed higher average test scores compared to other boroughs.
- A strong correlation between **attendance rates** and test scores was observed.
- Significant performance disparities were identified across different boroughs and demographics.
