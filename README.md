## Portfolio Projects

This Portfolio Contain 4 types of Project:

## Project-1:  Exploration and Cleaning Data in SQL

- Prepare dataset using Excel.
- Import dataset into SQLServer.
- Used Microsoft SQl Server to clean the data
- Converted data type to a suitable type to ensure it proper usage
- Populated missing data from the data itself to ensure crediblity
- Broke out columns into new individual columns for more precise results
- Created new Columns for the new ones
- Changed data withen a colmun to match like 'Y and N to Yes and No' so that the data matchs along each attribute
- Found and removed duplicates so there is no bias in the data
- Deleted unused columns to make ot more simple and fast while analyzing
- Obtain Nashville Housing datase: Original data source is here.
- Converting to Date format, populating NULL values, splitting data, modifying data, removing duplicates and deleting unused columns.
- Building our Visualizations.
- Building our Dashboard.

## Project-2: Analyzing Correlations using Python Pandas Library

- Obtain movie datset from Kaggle. Data source is from here.
- Read data as dataframe using Python Pandas.
- Prepare and clean data by: looking for missing data, converting data types, sorting and by dropping duplicates if necessary.
- Formulate hypotheses on correlations between variables.
- Analyze data by creating plots and correlation matrices using matplotlib and seaborn.
- Link to Python script!
