# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction

Predict whether a customer will churn based on their usage and demographic data.

## 🧠 Objective
To identify key factors that lead to customer churn and use machine learning models to predict churn likelihood.

## 📦 Dataset

- Records: ~7,000 customers
- Features: Demographics, services, account information

## 🔍 Project Steps
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
5. Evaluation Metrics (Accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC)

## 📊 Tools Used
