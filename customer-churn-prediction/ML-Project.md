# Customer Churn Prediction (Machine Learning)
A project where I built a machine learning model to predict customer churn based on historical data. 
The model includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and evaluation of performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
Skills: Data cleaning, machine learning, model evaluation, Python (Scikit-learn).

## ðŸ“œ Project Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict customer churn based on historical customer data. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used:
- **Python** (Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib)
- **Machine Learning** (Logistic Regression,)
- **Data Preprocessing** (Handling Missing Data, Feature Engineering)
- **Model Evaluation** (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC)
